- Tie a bool to the item itself to decide if it can be picked up
	- "You can pick up the mat but you can't pick up the mailbox."

- Each room will then have it's own items list
	- Room Name
	- Room Description
	- Room Items
		- Item Description

	-Enforce that items can only be in ONE PLACE AT A TIME


- Player Inventory
	- Not exactly a property for the player

- Commands to add:
	- Take / T: Pick up item listen in room
	- Inventory / I: Show the player's Inventory

- Need to parse the player's fed string into two bits, 
	- "Take" takes the item
	- "Item" the item that the player takes, you need to read the item that the player wants to take
	- EX: "Take helmet" (Proposition of TAKE, specification of the helmet that is being taken)

	- Treat the space between the PROPOSITION and OBJECT/ITEM as the splitter
